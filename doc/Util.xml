<Heading>Brauer characters with respect to different lifts</Heading>

Let  <M>G</M> be  a  finite group,  <M>g  \in G</M>,  and  <M>\rho: G  \to
GL(d,p^n)</M>be a representation over a finite field. The Brauer character
value  <M>\chi(g)</M>  of  <M>\rho</M>  at  <M>g</M>  is  defined  as  the
sum  of the  eigenvalues of  <M>\rho(g)</M>  in the  algebraic closure  of
<M>\mathbb{F}_p</M> lifted to complex roots of unity.
<P/>
The lift  used by <Ref  BookName="Reference" Oper="BrauerCharacterValue"/>
and in the computation of  many Brauer character tables (available through
the <Package>CTblLib</Package>  package) is defined by  Conway polynomials
(see <Ref BookName="Reference" Func="ConwayPolynomial"/>): They define the
primitive root  <C>Z(q)</C> in <C>GF(q)</C>  which is mapped  to <M>\exp(2
\pi i / (q-1))</M> (that is <C>E(q-1)</C> in &GAP;).
<P/>
Another     lift      is     defined     by     the      function     <Ref
Func="StandardCyclicGenerator"/>   provided   by   this   package.   Here,
<C>StandardCyclicGenerator(F, m)</C> is mapped to <M>\exp(2 \pi i / m)</M>
(that is <C>E(m)</C> in &GAP;).
<P/>
The following function translates between these two lifts.

<#Include Label="StandardValuesBrauerCharacter">

The inverse of a lift is used to reduce character values in characteristic
<M>0</M>  modulo  a   prime  <M>p</M>.  Choosing  a   lift  is  equivalent
to  choosing  a  <M>p</M>-modular  system. &GAP;  has  the  function  <Ref
BookName="Reference" Attr="FrobeniusCharacterValue"/>  which computes this
reduction with respect to the lift defined by Conway polynomials.
<P/>
Here is the corresponding function with respect to the lift constructed in
this package.

<Heading>Undocumented features</Heading>
We mention some features of this package which may be temporary, vanish or
changed.

The    functions   <Ref    Func="StandardFiniteFieldTower"/>   and    <Ref
Func="StandardPrimeDegreePolynomial"/>    take   an    optional   argument
<C>"Trace"</C>. In  that case  different irreducible polynomials  of prime
degree  <M>r</M> are  computed  when <M>r</M>  is  not the  characteristic
<M>p</M> of  the field and  <M>r</M> does  not divide <M>p-1</M>.  It uses
computations in larger  fields which contain <M>r</M>-th roots  of one and
traces  into <M>r</M>-power  extensions over  the prime  field (see  <Cite
Key="StdFFCyc" Where="5.4"/> for details).
<P/>
The  function  <C>SFFHelper.GFCyclotomicPolynomials(r,  q)</C> may  be  of
independent interest: For a power <M>q</M> of a prime <M>p</M> and another
prime  <M>r</M> it  returns  the irreducible  factors  of the  <M>r</M>-th
cyclotomic polynomial <M>(X^r-1)/(X-1)</M> over <C>GF(q)</C>.
<P/>
A   directory  <F>ntl</F>   contains  some   simple  standalone   programs
which  use  the  library  NTL  <Cite  Key="NTL"/>.  There  is  a  function
<C>StandardIrreducibleCoeffListNTL(K, d, a)</C> which  can be used instead
of  <C>StandardIrreducibleCoeffListNTL(K, d,  a)</C>  when  <C>K</C> is  a
prime field.  This gives a  good speedup for  not too small  <C>d</C>, say
<C>d</C> <M>>500</M>.
